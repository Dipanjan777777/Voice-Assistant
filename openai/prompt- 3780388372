 Basic

AI Basic is a programming language designed specifically for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. It was created in the 1960s by Bob Albrecht of the Stanford Research Institute. The language is based on the original AI programming language called LISP. AI Basic has many of the same features as LISP, including a system of data types, powerful functions, and symbolic expressions that help to define complex rules. However, AI Basic differs from LISP in that it is a procedural language, rather than a functional language, meaning that code can be written in smaller, self-contained chunks, allowing for better performance and readability. Other features of AI Basic include an automated debugger, an integrated development environment, and an extensible library of common functions. AI Basic has been used to develop games, search engines, expert systems, and other sophisticated artificial intelligence applications.
